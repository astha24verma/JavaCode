GRAPH
-----
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices(or nodes) and edges.
A Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(V, E).

Representation of Graphs :
------------------------
There are two ways to store a graph:
  >  Adjacency Matrix
  >  Adjacency List

Comparison between Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List :

When the graph contains a large number of edges then it is good to store it as a matrix
because only some entries in the matrix will be empty.
An algorithm such as Primâ€™s and Dijkstra adjacency matrix is used to have less complexity.
